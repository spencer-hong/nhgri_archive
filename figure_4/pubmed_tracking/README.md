# pubmed_tracking

To count all of the specific mentions of a technology, organism, or a term, we look at the abstract, title, author-submitted keywords, and the MeSH terms associated with each paper in PubMed. Due to memory and compute considerations, we separate the tracking. After running all of the `match_{}.py` scripts, you can run `combine.py` to create a final matrix that should result in a X by Y matrix, where X is the number of terms matched and Y is the number of publications in PubMed during the time period you have chosen. A key warning is that the index of this matrix (Y) has to be consistent with the PubMed data you pull. This means that version of PubMed or time window chosen should not change among scripts or analyses. Later, you can simply concatenate a `pubmed_id` column from the PubMed data files to this matrix. Do not shuffle the rows.

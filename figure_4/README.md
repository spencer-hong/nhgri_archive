### PubMed tracking

For calculating the community sizes of organisms, the impact of sequencing on specific organisms, and the "genomics" community, we track the mentions of specific organisms or aliases to genomics in PubMed. See `pubmed_tracking/README.md` for more information.

### Modeling

We use [`decision_modeling.ipynb`](decision_modeling.ipynb) to model the decisions and run SHAP analysis. The initial dataset of decisions is provided with the manuscript as supplementary table S9. [`sequencing-decisions-impact.ipynb`](sequencing-decisions-impact.ipynb) creates the last part of Figure 4.

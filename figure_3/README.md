### Installation

This module requires PyTorch as a multimodal langauge model (LayoutLMV3) is used. Install HuggingFace, Torch, and other necessary dependencies. This module also requires graph-tool (https://graph-tool.skewed.de) and NetworkX. Finding versions that fit these modules in one environment will depend on your specific system. We provide one working example at `requirements.txt`. The system tested is on a x86_64 Linux system with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000.
